            On the day appointed for the beginning of the race, you take the <i>Banshee</i> out of the towering granite bay of Tak and into the Inland Sea. Abdul the Butcher's <i>Haveldar</i> cuts quietly through the water beside you.

            'Mine at last!' cackles your creditor. 'Next time you will not be so quick to gamble with money you do not have.' He and his sailors brush past you, going to claim your prize. Without a ship, you cannot continue your journey.
