On the day appointed for the beginning of the race, you take the Banshee out of the towering granite bay of Tak and into the Inland Sea. Abdul the Butcher's Haveldar cuts quietly through the water beside you. Far to the east is the hostile but rich port of Lagash; to the west is the Scythera Desert, across which the caravan routes to the cities of Kish, Calah and Assur run. To the south is the mountainous isle of Enraki.

Will you:
[Head towards Lagash] for a dangerous but daring raid against its coastal shipping?
[Travel to the Scythera Desert] to plunder the rich western caravans?
[Patrol the Inland Sea] via the isle of Enraki?
