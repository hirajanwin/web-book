# Thinking of how to code page links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext
wikitext internal links - [[Texas]] or [[Texas|Lone Star State]] where "Lone Star State" will be the text underlined linking to the 'Texas' page.

Ex:
London has [[public transport]] 
will link to the page "wiki/Public_transport/"

or
New York also has [[public transport|public transportation]].

---
For adv, how about auto-generating the page ids? See below:

London has [[public transport]]
will link to "/createpage/?bookid=n&frompageid=nn&fromlink=public+transport where nn is the current page number.
For admin user, the link will be displayed in a predetermined color.
For non-admin, the link won't be displayed, indicating that the target page isn't there yet.

Link to page 123 explicitly:
London has [[public transport=>123]] becomes "/bookname/123"

# URL structure:

/<book>/<page>

Ex.
/space_patrol/#1
/space_patrol/prologue
/space_patrol/bridge
/space_patrol/bridge_left_door
/space_patrol/bridge_conference_room

You are in the bridge.

What will you do:
[[bridge left door|Take the left door]] beside Lt. Commander Data.
[[bridge conference room|Exit to the conference room]] to meet with the crew.

gets translated to:

<p>You are in the bridge.</p>
<p>What will you do:</p>
<p><a href="/bridge_left_door/">Take the left door</a> beside Lt. Commander Data.</p>
<p><a href="/bridge_conference_room/">Exit to the conference room</a> to meet with the crew.</p>

# export book format (json):
{
    "name": "Space Patrol",
    "desc": "You are the star of the story. Choose from 10 possible endings.",
    "pages": {
        "1": "This is the first page.\nYou are in an empty house.\n",
        "2": "This is the second page.\nYou can go [[left=>3]] or [[right=>4]]."
        "3": "You go left."
        "4": "You go right.\n\n[[Go straight=>5]]."
        "5": "This is the fifth page.\nYou can go [[back=>4]] or [[restart=>1]]."
    }
}

Importing a book generates a new book_id into [book] and [pages_<book_id>] tables.
