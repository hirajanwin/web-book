Thinking of how to code page links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext
wikitext internal links - [[Texas]] or [[Texas|Lone Star State]] where "Lone Star State" will be the text underlined linking to the 'Texas' page.

Ex:
London has [[public transport]] 
will link to the page "wiki/Public_transport/"

or
New York also has [[public transport|public transportation]].
