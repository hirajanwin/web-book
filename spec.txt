# Thinking of how to code page links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext
wikitext internal links - [[Texas]] or [[Texas|Lone Star State]] where "Lone Star State" will be the text underlined linking to the 'Texas' page.

Ex:
London has [[public transport]] 
will link to the page "wiki/Public_transport/"

or
New York also has [[public transport|public transportation]].

---
For adv, how about auto-generating the page ids? See below:

London has [[public transport]]
will link to /BookName/123 where 123 is the generated number.

Link to page 123 explicitly:
London has [[public transport=>123]]



# URL structure:

/<book>/<page>

Ex.
/space_patrol/#1
/space_patrol/prologue
/space_patrol/bridge
/space_patrol/bridge_left_door
/space_patrol/bridge_conference_room

You are in the bridge.

What will you do:
[[bridge left door|Take the left door]] beside Lt. Commander Data.
[[bridge conference room|Exit to the conference room]] to meet with the crew.

gets translated to:

<p>You are in the bridge.</p>
<p>What will you do:</p>
<p><a href="/bridge_left_door/">Take the left door</a> beside Lt. Commander Data.</p>
<p><a href="/bridge_conference_room/">Exit to the conference room</a> to meet with the crew.</p>
